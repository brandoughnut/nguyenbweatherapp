Peer Review Comment: Great Great Job, I really like the design of the website, it looks very simple and alluring, and it's responsive for mobile too. All of the functionality work like searching or favoriting a city, and I even like how he styled the favorite locatinos. I also like the addtion of adding a shelf on the left side that opens and closes on mobile. Another thing that I really like is that the background will change to dark, based off of the location's weather. I also liked how his website was able to grab my actual location, by leveraging the api's geolocation endpoint. Looking at his code I really like how he was able to leverage the Date object to grab the current date. I also liked how he used higher order methods to render in elements, and even used a method like .slice for his 5 day forecast data. Again, great job! (I might steal your geolocation idea)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
