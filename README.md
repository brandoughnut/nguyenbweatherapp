Peer Review Comment: Great Great Job, I really like the design of the website, it looks very simple and alluring, and it's responsive for mobile too. All of the functionality work like searching or favoriting a city, and I even like how he styled the favorite locatinos. I also like the addtion of adding a shelf on the left side that opens and closes on mobile. Another thing that I really like is that the background will change to dark, based off of the location's weather. I also liked how his website was able to grab my actual location, by leveraging the api's geolocation endpoint. Looking at his code I really like how he was able to leverage the Date object to grab the current date. I also liked how he used higher order methods to render in elements, and even used a method like .slice for his 5 day forecast data. Again, great job! (I might steal your geolocation idea)
